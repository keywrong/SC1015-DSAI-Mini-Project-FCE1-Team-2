    "<p>Data preparation and cleaning are crucial in the data analysis process. It transform raw data into a form that is suitable for analysis. </p>\n",

    "The following are some key steps involved in our data preparation and cleaning process:\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. **Data Collection**: our raw dataset is from the 2021 BRFSS survey data done by the CDC, based on more than 400,000 survey participants in the US. The original data file: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2021.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">2. **Data Extraction**: the survey dataset has 303 columns, from responses to the different questions asked in the survey. To identify factors releted to Diabetes, ample research was conducted. Relevant variable columns are then identified and extracted from the survey dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">3. **Data Cleaning**: steps taken to clean the dataset include tackling missing values from survey respondents and dropping irrelevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">4. **Data Transformation**: after cleaning, the data is transformed into a format that is suitable for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">5. **Data Documentation & Export**: lastly, a detailed documentation of the data. Our codebook can be found in the data description file."

    "### Step 1: Extract columns that are relevant to our problem, i.e., diabetes analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "After ample secondary research, the following factors are identified to have close relationship with diabetes:\n",
    "- **BMI**: In obese individuals, the amount of nonesterified fatty acids, glycerol, hormones, cytokines, proinflammatory markers, and other substances that are involved in the development of insulin resistance, is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Physical Exercise**: Inactivity increases visceral fat accumulation, stimulating chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and dependent comorbidities such as insulin resistance and Diabetes Mellitus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fruit Intake**: Fruits are an important part of a healthy diet,rich in nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that are important for maintaining overall health. Some studies have suggested that increased fruit intake may be related to a lower risk of diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vegetables Intake**: Vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet, and they are rich in nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber that are essential for maintaining overall health. Several studies have suggested that increased vegetable intake may be related to a lower risk of diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alcohol Consumption Habit**: Regular heavy drinking can reduce the body's sensitivity to insulin, which can trigger type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is a common side effect of chronic pancreatitis, which may be caused by heavy drinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smoker**: Tobacco use can raise your blood glucose (sugar) and reduce your body's ability to use insulin. In fact, people who smoke cigarettes are 30%–40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than people who don't smoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mental Health Problem**: Psychiatric disorders can disrupt sleep and impair a person's metabolism, leading to an increased risk of diabetes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Physical Health Problem**: People with diabetes have a higher risk of physical health problems including heart attack, stroke and kidney failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Age**: According to a survey, the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes among people aged 40–49 is 11.1% and 40.3%, respectively, while the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes among people aged 60–69 has increased to 23.9% and 47.6%, respectively. Advanced age is a major risk factor for diabetes and prediabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Difficulty walking or climbing**: Individuals with diabetes walk slower and with shorter step lengths, a longer stance phase, a wider base of support, greater step time variability on irregular surfaces, and improper pressure distribution at the foot compared with individuals without diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chronic Health Conditions**: Over time, diabetes can damage blood vessels in the heart, eyes, kidneys and nerves. People with diabetes have a higher risk of health problems including heart attack, stroke and kidney failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Blood Pressure**: Diabetes causes damage by scarring the kidneys, which in turn leads to salt and water retention, which in turn raises blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cholesterol**: Clinical studies have shown that increased cholesterol levels lead to deterioration of glucose tolerance, and that a high total cholesterol (TC) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio can predict type 2 diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Education**: Holding other factors constant, an increase of a year of schooling decreases the hazard of being diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus by 0.04.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gender**: Worldwide, an estimated 17.7 million more men than women have diabetes mellitus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Have any health insurance**: People without health insurance would be less inclined to check if they have diabetes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Afford to see doctor**: People with lesser ability to visit the doctor would have limited access to healthcare, thus exacerbating diabetes prevalence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **General Health**: The most common long-term diabetes-related health problems are: damage to the large blood vessels of the heart, brain and legs (macrovascular complications) damage to the small blood vessels, causing problems in the eyes, kidneys, feet and nerves (microvascular complications).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Income**: Lower income often correlates with limited healthcare access and preventive measures, exacerbating diabetes prevalence.\n",
